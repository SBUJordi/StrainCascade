# Apptainer images directory

## Overview

This directory is designated for storing all Apptainer (formerly Singularity) images required for StrainCascade. These images contain the necessary software and dependencies to run StrainCascade. Initially, this directory will be empty and is populated during the installation process.

## Usage

-   The `StrainCascade_installation.sh` script automatically pulls the required Docker images from Docker Hub, converts them to Apptainer format, and stores them here.
-   Do not change the structure of this directory or the names its contents.
