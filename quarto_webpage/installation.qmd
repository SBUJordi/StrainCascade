## System requirements

-   Linux OS (e.g., CentOS, Ubuntu, Debian, etc.)

-   \~ 500GB disk space software and reference databases

-   For optimal performance, we recommend running StrainCascade with 32 CPU cores, with 10GB of RAM allocated per core. However, less will also work.

## Installation dependencies

-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

-   [Apptainer](https://apptainer.org/)

-   All further software dependencies (listed in detail under [Dependencies](dependencies.qmd)) are bundled in Apptainer images, which are automatically downloaded and used when installing/running StrainCascade. This approach enhances:

    1.  Ease of use: Simplified installation and execution process

    2.  Portability: Consistent performance across different computing environments

    3.  Reproducibility: Ensures identical software environments for all users

    4.  Version control: Precise management of software versions and their interactions Isolation: Minimises conflicts with existing system libraries

## Installation steps

Clone the StrainCascade GitHub repository

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/SBUJordi/StrainCascade.git
```

Move to the StrainCascade directory

``` bash
cd StrainCascade
```

Make the StrainCascade scripts executable

``` bash
chmod +x scripts/*
```

Execute the installation script (pulls Apptainer images and downloads databases)

``` bash
./scripts/StrainCascade_installation.sh
```

You will be prompted by an interactive installation guide if you have enough disk space.

``` console
Running StrainCascade installation...
Sufficient disk space available: XXXGB
Apptainer is installed.
Do you want to do a full installation of StrainCascade? (y/n)
```

For a complete installation from scratch, choose `y` when asked:

``` bash
y
```

The installation process will take a while.
