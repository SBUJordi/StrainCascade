# Databases Directory

## Overview
This directory is intended to store all the database files required by the pipeline. These databases will be downloaded and populated by the `install.sh` script.

## Usage
- The `install_StrainCascade.sh` script will automatically download the necessary databases and place them in this directory.
- Ensure you have enough disk space before running the installation script, as some databases might be large.

## List of databases

## Notes
- This directory is empty initially and will be populated during the installation process.
- If you need to manually add or update databases, place them in this directory and update any relevant configuration files.
